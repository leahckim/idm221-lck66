# Hi, my name is **Leah Kim** 
## a designer currently attending Drexel University

# 2. **ABOUT ME**
## My name is Leah Kim and I am a sophomore UX/ID designer who is passionate about creating design that is **innovative**, **playful**, and **human-centered**. I love talking to others and learning about them, using **empathy** to guide my designs.
I have a background in product design and building physical prototypes as well as graphic design utilizing photoshop, illustrator, and indesign to showcase my work through posters as well as creating brand guidelines. I am a fast learner and I find learning new programs fun and rewarding.
Besides design I have a strong interest in cooking, fashion, and music. I love food and eating delicious meals is part of what makes my day, and like any other project I work on, I feel proud when I put work into creating meals that are delicious and fulfilling. I have played piano and violin since I was little and have always had a strong interest in music. I also am often pairing together outfits or scrolling on Pinterest for inspiration which is why I also work part-time at Urban Outfitters as it aids another creative outlet for myself.

# 4. **PORTFOLIO**

## 1. Float Lamp
Float lamp is a lamp with form designed to evoke feelings of warmth, familiarity, and tranqility. It is made using rice paper and was formed using a rolled up piece of paper wrapped in plastic wrap to form a paper lamp shade that allows the light to glow throughout a room.

## 2. Whisk
The whisk that I designed has a malleable handle that is made to form to anybody's hand perfectly for maximum comfortability.

## 3. Deskcape
Deskcape was created to allow workers and/or students who spend most of their days at their desk indoors and aren't able to connect with nature because of this. It is proven that nature increases productivity and mood in the workplace so I wanted to create a desktop that showcases the beauty of wood grains and the curvilinear aspects of nature.

## 4. Cultureware
Cultureware provides an exciting way for users to learn more about other cultures and try new foods/recipes. I designed this product as a blindbox as I found that many users found the element of surprise and anticipation an exciting way to feel connected to new recipes and included aesthetically pleasing ceramic bowls in each blind box so that users would feel more inclinced to cook and use the dishes itself.

## 5. Brand Guidelines
Using indesign I made brand guidelines for Float Lamp creating a color scheme, font and photography guides, and a logo made with illustrator all used to enhance the feelings presented by the original lamp design towards the targeted user.
